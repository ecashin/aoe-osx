Known issues/TODO:
-------------------

- Avoid OS disk initialisation prompt when drive is an update LUN
- "Device removal" warning appears when offline devices are removed from system, or devices are grown
- Safe method of claiming a target already claimed by another device?
- Snow Leopard Compatibility?
- ZFS Compatibility?

Apple Issues
------------
- Saw issues modifying partitions on a device after growing the disk size (posted to group, waiting for reply)
- Fails to recovers interrupted transfer if all interfaces are disconnected and then re-connected (posted to group, waiting for reply)
- AoE storage is not marked as usable by Xsan. -- Ian following up with WWDR?
- MTU displayed incorrectly in the network preference pane -- r.6095148
- AoE drives not prompted for use as Time Machine backup -- r.6483363
- Disk util: remove 2nd partition and mounted drive not shown in diskutil but is in finder -- r.6486798
- IOATABlockStorage panics when reading/writing data (very rare)-- r.6480346


Change Log
----------

v0.3.0	- Add shelf/slot device description for disk utility

		- Fixed scaling issue on Logo
		- Added sort option in Preference pane
		- Wait for unmount callback before clearing config string
		- Handles MTU changing on connected interfaces
		- Config string shown in aoed info
		- Enabled interfaces shown in aoed info

		- Can retrieve info on particular target with aoed info command 
		- Fixed target numbering bug

v0.2.6	- All available interfaces available on install
		- Improve robustness when target is lost
		- Remove target when cstring is no longer ours (ie. claimed by another driver)
		- Partial fix for crash when enabling/disabling invalid interface number

v0.2.5	- Create installers
		- Remove drive from system when it has gone offline

v0.2.4	- Unified Leopard/Tiger projects

		- More device info is available before the disk has been claimed
		- Begin support for handling changed capacity
		- Fix multi-interface "load balancing"
		- Create separate project for tiger kext

v0.2.2	- Add slow start/congestion control
		- Add ability to set max block count from command line
		- Fix broken retransmit handling
		- Read prefPanel enabled ports from registry
		- AoE prefPanel now checks for valid aoed path
		- Fix size checks for chained mbufs
		- Can claim/unclaim from aoed
		- Moved mount/unmount handling to aoed instead of preference panel
		- Enabled interfaces now preserved when SR powers down
		- aoed now returns info on unclaimed device
		- purge send/sent queues when interface goes offline
		- aoed now saves modified preferences by default
		- Force immediate change to Pref panel authorisation view

v0.2.0	- Transfer left over sectors (fixes "cp" issue)
		- Drive isn't mounted/attached until it is claimed.
		- Report BSD name in info command
		- Fix MTU calculation for en ports != 0
		- Can set "transfer size" from user interface (aoed)

v0.1.0	- Use "DMA" for transfers, allowing larger block transfers to occur
		- Forced packets (from UI) now transmit through the command gate
		- search commands do not re-transmit after timeout
		- Outstanding buffer count is now stored per-interface/shelf

v0.0.6	- Preference panel now shows owner
		- Warning message displayed if trying to claim a device owned by a different computer
		- Support multiple ethernet paths working for a single target
		- Added load-balancing across interfaces

v0.0.5	- Add preference panel support

v0.0.4	- Added user interface support

v0.0.3	- Fixed bug where only a single interfaces would be seen
