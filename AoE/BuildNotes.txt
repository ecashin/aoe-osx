Build Notes
-----------

This project was built with XCode 3.1.1

To build the debug version, you'll need to install FireLog. First install the FireWire SDK

http://developer.apple.com/sdk/

[NOTE: This will require a (free) ADC account]

After installing the SDK, install FireLog
/Developer/FireWireSDK26/Tools/FireLog/FireLog 2.0.0.pkg

Note, the release build doesn't require this to be installed.
